# Rotten Tomatoes
## Setup

Uses a dataset found on Kaggle. Should be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrezaza/clapper-massive-rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-reviews) and placed in a folder called `raw`.

# Features

- none yet lol
- the reviews here also have a date attached to them, so it is possible to see if the overall rating changed over time (recency bias or so)
